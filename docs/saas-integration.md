## FAQ

### Do I need to remove these scripts if I use AdsOptimizer?
No. You can run both simultaneously. The scripts operate independently within Google Ads, while AdsOptimizer pulls data via the API.

### Is my data secure?
Yes. AdsOptimizer uses OAuth2 for authentication and only requests read-only access to your account data. We never store your Google credentials.

### Can I export my data?
Yes. All plans include CSV export. Agency and Enterprise plans include PDF reports and API access for full data portability.

### What's the difference between the scripts and the SaaS?
Scripts run inside Google Ads with its limitations (30-min runtime, 30-day lookback). AdsOptimizer runs on our servers with unlimited historical data and advanced analysis that isn't possible within Google Ads Scripts.
