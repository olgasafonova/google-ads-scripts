## FAQ

### Will I need to remove these scripts when the platform launches?
No. You can run both simultaneously. The scripts operate independently within Google Ads, while the platform pulls data via the API.

### What's the difference between the scripts and the platform?
Scripts run inside Google Ads with its limitations (30-min runtime, 30-day lookback). The platform runs on our servers with unlimited historical data and advanced analysis that isn't possible within Google Ads Scripts.

### Is my data secure?
Yes. We use OAuth2 for authentication and only request read-only access to your account data. We never store your Google credentials.
